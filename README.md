Python app with GUI made to store passwords with their site and username

HOW TO USE:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Edit the PastingPass.py file and add a master password where it says PasswordPlaceholder.
     (NOTE: The double quotation marks "" MUST be in the string: example: PasswordPlaceholder = "mypassword")
  3. Save the python file and run the file called builder.bat
  4. Wait until it finishes and once it does, go to dist folder
  5. Inside of it, you should see the .exe for the app
  6. Once you open it, it will ask for a password (the one you put in the 2nd step)
  7. After that, the app will open, and you'll be able to place the passwords for some services and the username

I hope this app is useful for you all!
